# Abstract	
Navigating tipping etiquette at restaurants or shops can be challenging due to inconsistencies across different locations and cultures. In our project, we aim to analyze the tipping behavior following meals at restaurants. Specifically, we seek to investigate whether various factors, such as gender or party size, influence tip amounts. To address this issue, we plan to employ a predictive model, such as linear regression, to estimate the expected tip for each individual based on the given variables. Our success criterion will be achieving a testing accuracy of 95% or greater to validate the effectiveness of our approach.

# Motivation and Question
The dataset we are utilizing for our tipping behavior analysis project is sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed information on restaurant transactions, focusing specifically on tip amounts. This dataset includes variables such as total bill amount, gender of the payer, party size, day of the week, time of day (lunch/dinner), and whether the party was a smoker or non-smoker. Our scientific inquiry revolves around understanding the impact of these factors on tipping behavior. By exploring this dataset, we aim to answer key questions such as: How does gender influence the amount of tips given? Do larger parties tend to leave higher or lower tips compared to smaller groups? Are tips affected by the time of day or day of the week? Through the application of predictive modeling techniques like linear regression, we intend to build a model that can accurately forecast tip amounts based on these variables.

# Planned Deliverables
One of our key deliverables will be a well-documented Python package containing all our code, ensuring functionality without runtime errors. This package will encapsulate our predictive model, leveraging machine learning techniques like linear regression to estimate tip amounts based on various customer-related variables. Additionally, we will create an insightful Jupyter Notebook that delves into the dataset through detailed visualizations and graphs, offering a nuanced understanding of tipping trends and patterns. In conjunction with our code and analyses, our project will include a research component focusing on identifying the most influential factors driving tipping behavior. Through this research, we aim to uncover why certain factors, such as gender, party size, or time of day, may play a more substantial role in determining tip amounts. Our definition of success encompasses not only the technical aspects of delivering a functional Python package and insightful Jupyter Notebook but also achieving a deep understanding of the underlying dynamics of tipping behavior. Partial success would be producing the linear regression model and visuals but having a less robust background and research section.

# Resources Required
We plan to use the "Tips Dataset" available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sakshisatre/tips-dataset) to complete our project analyzing restaurant tipping behavior. The dataset has columns that delineate variables such as total bill amount, tip amount, gender of the payer, party size, day of the week, time of day (lunch/dinner), and smoking status. In addition to the dataset, we will need sufficient computing power to process and analyze the data efficiently. This includes access to a computer with adequate memory and processing capabilities to handle machine learning tasks such as building predictive models using techniques like linear regression. Furthermore, we will use databases to source academic articles to provide background information and context for the influence of different variables on tipping behaviors.

# What will you learn 
Daniela: I plan to learn more about implementation through this project as we will have to experiment with models to see if logistic regression would be the best option to use, or maybe we will implement another model that we have briefly discussed, such as the decision tree classifier model, to give us a better accuracy result. With this project, I will be working on creating a classifying project, which was an interest I wrote on my goal-setting assignment as well. Additionally, I will be able to work on communicating effectively and collaboratively with my partner. 
Lenox: I aim to fully understand all aspects of our implementation, even if I do not complete them myself. I also hope to create good visualizations with clear axes and labels that showcase the important aspects of our data. Lastly, I want to fully contextualize any biases that we unearth in this project, providing ample background and research that show where these prejudices originate. From my goal section, I hope to contribute physical code to this assignment as well as help us stay organized and on top of our project (like completing assignments like these)

# Risk Statement
Something that can potentially stop us from achieving the full success outlined above is that if we come across problems with our code and have a harder time debugging, then we will have less time to research, so it will be done in less depth. Issues can arise as we code that sets us behind on our tentative schedule, thus leaving less time for research, as our priority would be to get the program running. Another scenario that can prevent us from achieving our deliverables is if we do not see a pattern between the customerâ€™s variables and the amount tipped. This may lead to low accuracy or inconclusive results. 

# Ethics Statement
From our project, restaurant and business owners as well as wait staff, will benefit from this model because they will be able to optimize tip profits by improving their customer service based on the patterns seen in the data. The insights derived from this model can inform various decisions within the hospitality industry, such as optimizing staff allocation based on expected tips during different times or tailoring customer service strategies to enhance overall satisfaction and tip revenue. However, there are people who our project can harm. One group can be those who are shown to be most likely to tip a larger sum as businesses will be tailored to them and avoid the cares and needs of other guests, or the businesses will use this information and take advantage of those people for monetary gain. Additionally, if the model reinforces biases, such as gender biases, it can be harmful to those groups of people. Despite these potential consequences, one assumption can be that if our project can provide more understanding and insights on tipping, it can enhance tipping practices to benefit the wait staff and business owners. Another assumption can be that the larger the bill, the larger the tip, as more work was done serving the guests. 


# Tentative Timeline:
